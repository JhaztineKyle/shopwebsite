				<h1>About The Band</h1>
				<p>LANY (/ˈleɪni/; an acronym for "Los Angeles New York") is an American indie pop band from Los Angeles, formed in 2014. The band consists of Paul Jason Klein, Charles Leslie "Les" Priest, and Jake Clifford Goss.
 Los Angeles-based trio LANY craft dreamy pop with an R&B spirit, heard on early EPs and the debut full-length LANY, which was issued in 2017.
  Formed in Nashville in 2014 by three friends -- Paul Jason Klein from Tulsa, Oklahoma and Leslie Priest and Jake Goss from Nashville -- the members of LANY studied music in college and are multi-instrumentalists. During a trip from L.A. to Nashville, Klein hooked up with Priest and Goss, who were working on their own project, WRLDS. They decided to start something new together and LANY was born. The band's name (pronounced "Lay-nee") is a nod to Los Angeles and New York, marking their desire to spread their music from coast to coast. That music combines the feel of '80s radio pop, '90s R&B soul, and atmospheric synths.They recorded their first two songs -- "Hot Lights" and "Walk Away" -- in four days. Continuing a prolific streak, they issued the three-song debut EP Acronyms and the five-track I Loved You. They continued to build a following while on the road, touring with Troye Sivan, Ellie Goulding, Halsey, and X Ambassadors. The group eventually signed with Polydor Records in December 2015. They released a third EP, the six-track Make Out, which culled tracks from their previous releases, including the song "ILYSB" ("I Love You So Bad"). The song was a hit online, reaching over 14 million streams.</p>
